# Amazon Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs a **comprehensive analysis** of an Amazon sales dataset, providing insights into sales trends, product performance, fulfillment methods, and geographical distribution of sales. The findings support **business decision-making** by identifying patterns and improvement areas.

## Dataset
The dataset contains sales transactions from Amazon, including:
- **Order details** (Order ID, Date, Status, Sales Channel)
- **Product details** (Category, Size, Quantity, Amount)
- **Fulfillment details** (Shipping method, shipping city, state, etc.)

## Key Objectives
1. **Sales Overview** - Analyze overall sales trends over time.
2. **Product Analysis** - Identify best-selling product categories, sizes, and quantities.
3. **Fulfillment Analysis** - Evaluate the effectiveness of different fulfillment methods.
4. **Customer Segmentation** - Group customers based on buying behavior and location.
5. **Geographical Analysis** - Visualize sales distribution across states and cities.
6. **Business Insights** - Provide actionable recommendations to improve sales strategies.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for running the analysis
- **Data Visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Steps to Run the Analysis
1. **Load the dataset**: Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Preprocess the data**:
   - Convert date columns to datetime format.
   - Handle missing values.
   - Drop unnecessary columns.
3. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generate summary statistics.
   - Identify trends and patterns.
   - Visualize key insights using charts.
4. **Generate Actionable Insights** based on the findings.

## Visualizations
The project includes the following charts:
- **Sales Trends** (Line chart for monthly sales)
- **Top-Selling Product Categories** (Bar chart)
- **Fulfillment Method Distribution** (Pie chart)
- **Sales by State** (Bar chart)
